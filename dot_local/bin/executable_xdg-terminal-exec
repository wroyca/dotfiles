# Shell-based implementation of the proposed Default Terminal Execution
# Specification. Launches preferred terminal emulator, with or without
# optionally supplied command.
#
# Terminal emulators are selected among Desktop Entries that are installed on
# the system, or added by user according to XDG Desktop Entry Spec. Only valid
# Entries with TerminalEmulator category and X-TerminalArgExec= key set are
# considered (X-TerminalArgExec= key is not required in compat mode).
#
# Command execution argument is determined by Entry's X-TerminalArgExec= key,
# (assumed to be -e by default in compat mode). If an actual -e or matching
# execution argument is given on the command line, it will be silently
# discarded.
#
# It is assumed that the emulator handles command line after the execution
# argument as is (preserved separate arguments).
