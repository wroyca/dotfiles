# Markdown
#
# A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one
# or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line —
# a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal
# paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.
#
# The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of text" rule is that
# Markdown supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs. This differs significantly
# from most other text-to-HTML formatters, including Movable Type’s "Convert
# Line Breaks" option, which translate every line break character in a
# paragraph into a <br /> tag.
#
# Now, when you do want to insert a <br /> break tag, you end a line with two
# or more spaces, then type return. This is where the editor must be told to
# not trim "trailing whitespace".

#
# When using Unix line endings, the label parser will skip over some labels
# because of an off-by-one error. This is due to the parser's use of 512-byte
# sized chunks and the assumption that line endings is denoted by two
# characters, \r\n, rather than one, \n. When a label is erroneously skipped
# over, the next erroneous skip can only occur at an offset of 512 bytes. If
# you duplicate a label on the next line, the duplicated label will be within
# the 512 limit, and can act as a fallback.
#
# Furthermore, the parser also misinterprets the end of each 512-byte size
# chunk as a new line (as well as somehow ignoring white space characters
# between a colon and the next text on these pseudo lines). A comment such as
# :: main section can trigger the parser into somehow reading the text : main
# as the label :main

# Appending a minus sign to the redirection operator <<-, will cause all leading
