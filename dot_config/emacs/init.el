;; The problem we are solving here is in some sense mundane, yet
;; annoyingly subtle: making prefix keymaps both self-documenting
;; and properly integrated with `which-key` when the key in question
;; comes from the keypad (or any other less conventional source).
;;
;; By default, Emacs keymap definitions are only half the story:
;; one can bind keys to functions, but the descriptions shown in
;; `which-key` (and other helpers) require an extra, parallel set
;; of declarations. This redundancy is tolerable when you have a
;; handful of bindings, but once you start introducing structured
;; prefix keymaps (e.g., "File", "Buffers", "Windows"), the boilerplate
;; multiplies quickly. Worse still, consistency between what's bound
;; and what's shown becomes fragile: update one without the other and
;; you've invited confusion.
;;
;; There is also the keypad wrinkle: Emacs treats keypad keys as
;; distinct from their regular counterparts (e.g., `kp-1` versus `1`),
;; yet `which-key` doesn't really care and would happily show nothing
;; or something misleading. Out of the box, there's no clean way to
;; say "bind this here, and describe it there, and do so recursively
;; for nested prefixes."
;;
;; The result is this macro, which may look monstrous at first sight,
;; but whose monstrosity is deliberate: we take on complexity once,
;; centrally, so that we can write succinct, declarative
;; prefix specifications thereafter.
