;;; dotemacs-mouse.el --- Persistent selections -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Architectural Overview
;;
;; Overlay-Based Selection Model
;;
;; Represent selections using overlays instead of the point/mark pair:
;;
;; - Spatial independence: Decouple overlay visibility from
;;   `point'. Maintain visual selection continuity during cursor
;;   motion and scrolling.
;;
;; - Display priority enforcement: Assign overlays a priority of 1001
;;   to override conflicting visual properties from other packages.
;;
;; - Cached positional metadata: Store character positions in
;;   `dotemacs-mouse--region-begin' and `dotemacs-mouse--region-end'
;;   to eliminate overlay introspection at runtime.
;;
;; Input Event Interception
;;
;; Intercept interactive input events using the following strategies:
;;
;; - Function remapping: Remap mouse-related commands
;;   (e.g. `mwheel-scroll') to wrappers that preserve overlay
;;   selections during event execution.
;;
;; - Advice instrumentation: Advise mutating commands
;;   (e.g. `self-insert-command') to detect active overlay regions and
;;   enforce type-to-replace semantics.
;;
;; - Pre-command hook monitoring: Detect drag initiations and state
;;   transitions via `pre-command-hook'. Synchronize overlay state
;;   teardown and reinitialization.
;;
;; Selection State Management
;;
;; Track selection state using three coordinated components:
;;
;; 1. `dotemacs-mouse--region-begin' and `dotemacs-mouse--region-end':
;;    Store absolute buffer positions as integers. Avoid markers to
;;    prevent drift during unrelated edits.
;;
;; 2. `dotemacs-mouse--overlays': Maintain a list of active overlays
;;    representing the rendered selection.
;;
;; 3. `dotemacs-mouse/selection-mode': Indicate whether overlay-based
;;    selection is active in the current buffer.
;;
;; Compatibility Layer with Emacs Primitives
;;
;; Integrate with core Emacs subsystems:
;;
;; - `delete-selection-mode': Treat active overlays as virtual regions
;;   to support overwrite behavior.
;;
;; - `transient-mark-mode': Enable temporarily to delegate to built-in
;;   region logic when necessary.
;;
;; - Scroll subsystem (`mwheel.el'): Handle mouse wheel input in
;;   accordance with `scroll-command' conventions to maintain motion
;;   compatibility.
;;
;; Selection Model Transitions
;;
;; Use `dotemacs-mouse/activate-mark' to detect the current selection
;; state and perform transitions between overlay-based selections and
;; point/mark regions. Fallback to native region behavior when
;; required.
;;
;; Performance and Resource Control
;;
;; Apply runtime optimizations to minimize overhead:
;;
;; - Buffer-local hooks: Add hooks (e.g. `pre-command-hook') locally
;;   and deactivate them when not in use.
;;
;; - Deterministic overlay lifecycle: Create overlays on demand and
;;   remove them explicitly to avoid lingering artifacts.
;;
;; - Cached position tracking: Update buffer positions
;;   transactionally. Avoid repeated calls to `overlay-start' and
;;   `overlay-end' during high-frequency commands.
