{{- /* This file exists as a deliberate countermeasure against the increasingly
common problem of applications being overzealous in claiming MIME type
associations without consent.

Too many applications assume ownership over a wide range of file types, from
plain text and configuration files to source code, on the assumption that every
file might relate to their use case. This behavior is not just presumptuous,
it's actively disruptive.

The problem is systemic: many applications follow a "claim everything, ask
later" philosophy. IDEs grab every programming language extension, media players
seize control of all audio and video formats, and office suites appropriate
every document type. The result is that double-clicking a simple .txt file may
launch a heavyweight IDE instead of a lightweight text editor.

To mitigate this, the associations defined here are explicit and intentional.
That is, they reflect actual usage patterns rather than speculative defaults. */ -}}
