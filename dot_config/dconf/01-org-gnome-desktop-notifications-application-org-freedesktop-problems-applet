# Spurious crashes may occur frequently, particularly with obscure background
# processes. In most cases, these crashes can be ignored as they typically
# recover on their own. Some applications may crash and immediately recover,
# while others may not crash at all yet still generate alerts in the problems
# applet for various reasons. Since crash dumps and logs are accessible through
# other means, crash notifications have been disabled to reduce unnecessary
# alerts and/or spam.
