# Spurious crashes may happen frequently, especially with obscure background
# processes. More often than not, these can be ignored as they typically recover
# on their own. Some applications may crash and recover immediately, while
# others may not crash at all but still spam the problems applet for various
# reasons. Crash dumps and logs can be accessed by other means, so crash
# notifications are disabled to avoid spam.
