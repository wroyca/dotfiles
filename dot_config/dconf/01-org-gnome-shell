# Although this previously worked, it appears to have been broken at some point
# during the GNOME 46 update cycle. Specifically, while the value is still
# saved in dconf, it is no longer read from there. This suggests that the power
# profile might now store or read the preference value elsewhere, though I
# havenâ€™t looked into where that might be or confirmed if this assumption is
# accurate.
#
# For now, keep it as-is in case it resolves itself in a future update or if we
# ever decide to investigate further.
