# Configure rounded window corners for specific applications. Note that we use
# a fork of the Gnome Rounded Window Corners Extension that supports customizable
# whitelist.

# Disable artificial window borders globally. This looks out of place in most
# cases.
#
border-width='0'

# There's only a few application that we need rounded corners for, so we
# certainely don't want to apply rounded window corners in a global context.
# Thus, treat the blacklist array as a whitelist.
#
whitelist=true

# Whitelist applications. Mostly for applications built with UI toolkits that
# don't support rounded corners by default.
#
# E.g.:
# - https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/33036
# - https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-7476/No-rounded-corners-and-no-shadow-in-Linux-KDE-Plasma-using-pure-Wayland
#
blacklist=['jetbrains-clion']

# Configure per-application settings. For now, only CLion is configured.
#
# CLion settings:
# - Padding = 2 on all sides for proper corner clipping.
# - Everything else is default.
