# GNOME's ability to reliably resume from suspend is inconsistent, making it
# unpredictableâ€”essentially a coin toss. To avoid potential issues, disable
# suspend when the system is on AC power (i.e., plugged into a power source).
#
# Note: When changing this, we must also update org.gnome.desktop.session
# idle-delay.
