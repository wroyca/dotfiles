# Disable confirmation prompts for commands that may have side effects. Useful
# in workflows where the intent is already understood and interruptions are
# unnecessary.

set confirm off

# Suppress verbose internal messages. Reduces noise while preserving relevant
# output such as errors and explicit user interactions.
#
set verbose off

# Configure persistent command history. Stores session history in a file under
# the home directory for later recall.

# clutter from repeated invocations while retaining meaningful variation.

# Enable automatic history saving across sessions.

# Disable printing of entire arrays by default. Prevents excessive output when
# working with large data structures. Elements remain accessible via indexing.
#
set print array off

# Show element indices when printing arrays. Important for interpreting
# structure and identifying positions, particularly in multidimensional
# contexts.
#
set print array-indexes on

# Enable structured formatting of complex types. Improves readability through
# indentation and line breaks.
#
set print pretty on

# Remove output width limits. Avoids truncation and line wrapping on wide
# displays.
#
set width unlimited

# Remove output height limits. Allows uninterrupted printing of large data sets
# without requiring user input.
#
set height unlimited

# Disable paging through output. Allows continuous scrolling without prompts.
#
set pagination off

# Set disassembly output to Intel syntax. Easier to read due to more
# conventional operand ordering and syntax. Preferable to AT&T format in most
# cases.
#

# Skip debugging into the C++ standard library. Reduces noise by avoiding
# internal implementation details and focusing on user code. GDB requires
# explicit wildcards for recursive matching, as '**/' is not supported.
