# Disables confirmation prompts for potentially destructive commands.
# Streamlines debugging workflow by assuming we understand command impact.
#
set confirm off

# Suppresses detailed internal operation messages. Reduces noise while
# maintaining essential debugging output and error messages.
#
set verbose off

# Configures command history persistence. Stores history in our home directory,
# maintaining chronological record of debug sessions.
#
set history filename ~/.gdb_history

# Deduplicates history entries within sliding window of 10 commands. Prevents
# history pollution from repeated command sequences while preserving distinct
# command variations.
#
set history remove-duplicates 10

# Enables automatic history persistence between sessions.
#
set history save

# Disables array value printing by default. Prevents output flooding when
# examining large arrays, values still accessible via indexing.
#
set print array off

# Shows array indices during element printing. Critical for correlating values
# with their positions, especially in multidimensional arrays.
#
set print array-indexes on

# Enables structured pretty-printing of complex data types. Formats output with
# indentation and line breaks for readability.
#
set print pretty on

# Removes terminal width restrictions on output formatting. Prevents data
# truncation and line wrapping in wide displays.
#
set width unlimited

# Disables terminal height limits. Ensures continuous output display without
# manual interaction for long data dumps.
#
set height unlimited

# Disables output pagination. Allows continuous scrolling through large outputs
# without 'more' style interruptions.
#
set pagination off

# Sets x86 assembly syntax to Intel format. Provides more readable disassembly
# with explicit operand order and simpler notation. Life is too short for
# AT&T's reversed operands and % prefixes.
#
set disassembly-flavor intel

# Skips debugging into C++ standard library implementation. Prevents debugger
# from entering internal stdlib functions, focusing on our code. GDB's path
# matching requires explicit wildcards per directory (/*/ instead of /**/) due
# to its recursive glob implementation quirk.
