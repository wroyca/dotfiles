# Fedora Workstation no longer pre-installs deprecated GNOME X11 session for
# new installations. The problem is that Wine can sometimes end up in a broken
# state on Wayland (presumably, something wrong gets cached somewhere), which
# causes games that previously ran fine to start crashing every few minutes.
# It's not clear to me what the cause is or where the faulty cache lies, but
# using X11 stops crashes from happening, so weâ€™ll want to preserve GNOME X11
# session for now.

# Install DirectShow filters based on the libavformat and libavcodec libraries

# This addresses a common issue in older games where in-game cutscenes or
# movies would only show a black screen instead of the intended video content.
# Notable examples of such games include the Trails series from Nihon Falcom.
