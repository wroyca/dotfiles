# If enabled, DNF will continue running and disable the repository that couldn't
# be synchronized for any reason. This option doesn't affect skipping of un‐
# available packages after dependency resolution. To check inaccessibility of
# repository use it in combination with refresh command line  option.  The  de‐
# fault is False.

# If enabled a metric is used to find the fastest available mirror. This
# overrides the order provided by the mirrorlist/metalink file itself. This file
# is often dynamically generated by the server to provide the best download
# speeds and enabling fastestmirror overrides this. The default is False.

fastestmirror=True

# This sets the low speed threshold in bytes per second. If the server is
# sending data at the same or slower speed than this value for at least timeout
# op‐ tion seconds, DNF aborts the connection. The default is 1000. Valid units
# are 'k', 'M', 'G'.

# Maximum number of simultaneous package downloads. Defaults to 3. Maximum of
