# If enabled, DNF will continue running and disable any repository that
# couldn't be synchronized for any reason. This option does not affect the
# skipping of unavailable packages after dependency resolution. To check the
# inaccessibility of a repository, use this in combination with the refresh
# command-line option. The default value is False.

skip_if_unavailable=True

# If enabled, a metric is used to find the fastest available mirror, overriding
# the order specified by the mirrorlist or metalink file. These files are often
# dynamically generated by the server to offer the best download speeds, but
# enabling fastestmirror will override this behavior. The default value is
# False.
#
fastestmirror=True

# This sets the low-speed threshold in bytes per second. If the server sends
# data at a rate equal to or slower than this value for at least the duration
# specified by the timeout option, DNF will abort the connection. The default
# value is 1000 bytes per second. Valid units are 'k', 'M', and 'G'.

minrate=5M

# Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous package downloads. The default
# value is 3, with a maximum of 20.
