[General]
# Enable Fast Connectable mode on adapters that support it.
#
# When enabled, the adapter advertises more aggressively, allowing other
# Bluetooth devices to initiate a connection immediately after discovery.
# This primarily improves latency for peripherals that are frequently
# connected and disconnected (e.g., headsets, keyboards).
#
# The cost is higher power usage due to increased advertising. On
# battery-powered systems this may be noticeable, but in practice the
# responsiveness gain is usually worth the trade-off.
