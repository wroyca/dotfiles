# The Ergodox EZ has this lovely habit of flashing its LEDs when the system
# keeps waking it up for no good reason, which it *will* do, thanks to USB
# wakeup being enabled by default.
#
# The fix is to just tell the kernel to stop treating the keyboard like an alarm
# button. We're not planning to wake the machine by slapping keys anyway, and
# this spares us the distracting light show (and maybe a little power too).
#
# So: locate the device, and if it exist, disable its wakeup trigger.
