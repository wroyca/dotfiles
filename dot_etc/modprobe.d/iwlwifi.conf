# Disables generic Wi-Fi power saving at the `iwlwifi` level. We explicitly turn
# it off (`power_save=0`) to avoid aggressive sleep transitions, which tend to
# cause connection instability, especially in conjunction with some access
# points.
#
# We also set `power_level=1`, which is the least aggressive non-zero level.
# While this may appear contradictory (since power saving is disabled), it
# reinforces the preference for responsiveness over marginal battery savings,
# and makes intent clear in case power_save gets re-enabled by a higher-level
# policy or distro default.
#
# Combined with the `iwlmvm` setting, this provides a conservative baseline for
# Wi-Fi power management: stability is prioritized over idle savings.

# Enables AMPDU (Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit) mode for 802.11n.
# Specifically, this disables bit 3 (`11n_disable=8`), which is the "no-AMPDU"
# flag in the driver's capability mask.
#
# In short: this allows multiple packets (MPDUs) to be aggregated into one
# larger transmission unit (AMPDU), reducing protocol overhead and increasing
# throughput.
#
# This is generally safe and beneficial, especially on modern routers. However,
# some users have reported issues with specific APs or chipsets. In our case,
# we've had no such trouble and we want to avoid needlessly degrading
# performance by leaving this feature disabled.
