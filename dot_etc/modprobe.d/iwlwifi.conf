# Disable generic Wi-Fi power saving at the iwlwifi layer.
#
# We explicitly set power_save=0 to avoid aggressive sleep transitions, which
# are a common source of latency spikes and connection instability, especially
# with certain access points.
#
# power_level is set to 1 (the least aggressive non-zero value). While power
# saving is disabled, this makes the intent explicit and preserves the bias
# toward responsiveness in case power_save is re-enabled by higher-level policy
# or distribution defaults.

options iwlwifi power_save=0
options iwlwifi power_level=1

# Enable AMPDU support for 802.11n operation.
#
# This clears the "no-AMPDU" capability bit (11n_disable=8), allowing multiple
# MPDUs to be aggregated into a single AMPDU. The result is reduced protocol
# overhead and higher effective throughput.
#
# On modern hardware and access points this is generally safe and beneficial.
# While some AP / chipset combinations have historically shown issues, this
# setup has proven stable in practice, and leaving AMPDU disabled would
# unnecessarily cap performance.
