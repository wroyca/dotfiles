# Explicitly disables the GSP (GPU System Processor) firmware path used by
# recent NVIDIA drivers. When enabled, this offloads responsibilities like power
# management, scheduling, and microcode management to a RISC-V coprocessor
# embedded in newer NVIDIA GPUs (Turing and later).
#
# The long-term intent behind GSP is sound. It reduces the host driver's
# complexity and shifts timing-sensitive operations closer to the hardware.
# However, in its current form, the firmware is still immature: it introduces
# performance regressions and occasional latency spikes under load. These issues
# have been observed across multiple driver versions and hardware variants.
#
# We disable GSP here to retain the older, fully host-managed execution path.
# While this forgoes some of the theoretical gains from firmware offloading, it
# restores baseline performance and avoids edge-case failures that are otherwise
# difficult to reproduce or debug.
#
# This setting may be revisited as firmware maturity improves or becomes
# mandatory in future releases.
