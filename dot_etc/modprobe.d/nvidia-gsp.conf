# Disable the GSP (GPU System Processor) firmware execution path.
#
# Recent NVIDIA drivers can offload power management, scheduling, and related
# control logic to a RISC-V coprocessor embedded in newer GPUs. While the design
# direction is reasonable, the current GSP firmware has shown performance
# regressions and sporadic latency spikes under load across multiple driver
# releases and hardware variants.
#
# We disable GSP here to force the legacy, fully host-managed driver path. This
# sacrifices some theoretical benefits of firmware offloading, but restores
# predictable performance and avoids hard-to-diagnose edge cases.
