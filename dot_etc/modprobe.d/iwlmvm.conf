# Configure the iwlmvm driver to use power scheme 1 (power saving disabled).
#
# This is a deliberate bias toward stability and latency. By disabling power
# saving, we avoid sleep/wake behavior that can short throughput drops.
#
# Note that power consumption increases as a result, but that is an explicit
# and accepted trade-off in environments where network performance is the
# primary concern.
