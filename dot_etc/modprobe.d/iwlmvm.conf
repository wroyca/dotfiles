# This instructs the `iwlmvm` driver to use power scheme 1, which disables power
# saving entirely.
#
# The intent here is to prioritize connection stability and low latency,
# accepting higher power usage in exchange for reliable throughput and fast
# reconnections.
#
# This is especially relevant where network performance takes precedence over
# maximum efficiency.
