# newline at EOF confuses some older tools (and cat).

# Markdown hard breaks.
#
# Unlike code, Markdown relies on trailing whitespace (two spaces) to signify a
# hard line break (<br>). If we strip them, we break the rendering.
#
# We could use explicit <br> tags, but that makes the raw text harder to read.
# So we make an exception here and tolerate the invisible characters.

# Windows Batch 512-byte boundary bug.
#
# The Batch label parser reads files in 512-byte chunks. If we use Unix (LF)
# line endings, the parser can miscalculate the chunk boundary.
#
# If a label (:) straddles this boundary, the parser might miss the newline, or
# worst, treat the label as part of the previous line. The workaround here is
# to force CRLF, which aligns with the parser's 2-byte EOL assumption.
