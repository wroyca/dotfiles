# Markdown
#
# A paragraph in Markdown consists of one or more consecutive lines of text,
# separated by one or more blank lines. A blank line is any line that is empty
# or contains only spaces or tabs.
#
# Paragraphs should not begin with spaces or tabs for indentation. Leading
# whitespace may cause the paragraph to be interpreted as a code block.
#
# Markdown allows "hard-wrapped" paragraphs, that is, line breaks within a
# paragraph do not create <br /> tags by default. This differs from some systems
# (like Movable Type's “Convert Line Breaks” option), which treat every line
# break as a hard line break in HTML.
#
# To force a line break (<br />) within a paragraph, end the line with two or
# more spaces followed by a return. Be aware that editor may strip trailing
# spaces, so we need to make sure it preserves them if we rely on this feature.

# Batch
#
# When using Unix-style line endings (\n), the Batch file label parser may
# incorrectly skip some labels due to an off-by-one error. This happens because
# the parser reads input in 512-byte chunks and mistakenly assumes that line
# endings are two characters (\r\n) rather than one (\n).
#
# If a label is skipped because of this, the parser will not skip again until it
# reaches the next 512-byte boundary. To work around the issue, you can
# duplicate the label on the following line. As long as the duplicate remains
# within the 512-byte chunk, it will serve as a fallback and be recognized
# correctly.
#
# Note that the parser also treats the boundary between 512-byte chunks as a new
# line, which can cause additional misinterpretation. It may ignore whitespace
# between a colon and the label text on these lines. For example, a comment like
# :: main section could be misread as the label :main.
