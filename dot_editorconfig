# Markdown
#
# A paragraph consists of one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by
# one or more blank lines. A blank line is defined as any line that appears
# empty; it may contain only spaces or tabs. Normal paragraphs should not begin
# with spaces or tabs for indentation.
#
# The rule of "one or more consecutive lines of text" means that Markdown
# supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs. This is notably different from many
# other text-to-HTML converters, such as Movable Type's "Convert Line Breaks"
# option, which converts every line break within a paragraph into a <br /> tag.
#
# If you need to insert a <br /> tag for a line break, end the line with two or
# more spaces and then press return. Note that editors must be told to preserve
# "trailing whitespace" to maintain this formatting.

# Batch
#
# When using Unix line endings (\n), the label parser may skip over some labels
# due to an off-by-one error. This error occurs because the parser processes
# data in 512-byte chunks and incorrectly assumes that line endings are
# represented by two characters (\r\n) instead of one (\n). If a label is
# mistakenly skipped, the next skip will only happen at a 512-byte offset. To
# prevent this, you can duplicate a label on the following line, keeping it
# within the 512-byte limit, which allows the duplicate label to act as a
# fallback.
#
# Additionally, the parser misinterprets the end of each 512-byte chunk as a
# new line and also overlooks whitespace characters between a colon and the
# subsequent text on these pseudo-lines. For example, a comment like `:: main
# section` may lead the parser to incorrectly interpret the text as the label
# :main.
